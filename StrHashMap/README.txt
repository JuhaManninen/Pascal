Documentation for the component can be found here:

There is an Example Application, at dir "Example".

To install and run:

* From Example directory open HashMapDemo1.lpi
* Build it
* Run it at console so that you can see the output.
* Inspect the source code based on the output. 

The example application first builds a database of South Park episodes and then demonstrates the following features of StringHashMap:

* Search data records with lightning speed using hash keys.
* Array syntax: Map[Key]
* Find function: Map.Find(Key, Pointer)
* FindData function: Map.FindData(Pointer, Key)
* Iterating elements
* Using the data pointer as integer, making a very efficient word counter. 


I don't want to write more here because I would just copy data from the above sources.
