This repository contains Object Pascal programs and libraries made with Lazarus /FPC.

ESS-Model
---------
It is a reverse engineering class diagram tool which I tried to port from Delphi to Lazarus.
It uses some tricks which make it difficult. It didn't work with latest Delphi either.
It will not be developed further.
The original Delphi project is in SourceForge but it has no activity for years.

StrHashMap
----------
A fast string -> pointer hash map implementation. Explained in:
 http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/StringHashMap

IntList
-------
A list container for integers. Works like TStringList does for strings.
